# Project-Nifty
A website compiling all existing creations around Nifty the goblin

It's a website I'm creating for training purposes (and fun, because training is always easier with fun)

Nifty was created by Tumblr user fuckyeahdnd with this licence : "You can copy, modify and distribute this work, even for commercial projects, strictly excluding those relating to or containing non-fungible tokens (so-called "NFT") or blockchain (related) projects."
This website and everything it contains use the same licence. I will source everything as much as possible.
